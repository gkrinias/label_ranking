- **LabelRankers.py** contains implementations of ranking classifiers using decision trees, random forest and reduction to halfspaces.

- **massart.py** contains auxiliary functions for adding noise to labels and permutations.

- **Temp.py** contains the implementation of the 1st new idea (updating the whole matrix using PSGD using sigmoid function).

- **Temp.py** contains the implementation of the 2nd new idea (updating the whole matrix using a perceptron like algorithm).

- **RankerComparisons1.ipynb**, **RankerComparisons2.ipynb** contain tests and plots.

- **RankerComparisons3.ipynb**, contains tests of the 1st new idea implementation.

- **RankerComparisons4.ipynb**, contains tests of the 2nd new idea implementation.
